# TRANCE HIMALAYA

_An Authentic Himalayan Homestay_

## WELCOME TO TRANCE HIMALAYA
Welcome to Trance Himalaya. Situated in the middle of serene Mandakini valley, and nestled within the Kedar Himalayas, our homestay beckons you to breathe crisp and cool air and to get enchanting views of the snow covered Himalayan peaks. Take silent rejuvenating walks in the lush green jungles of the valley and slopes while listening to the chirping of birds, music of the insects, and soothing lullaby of the shaded brooks. Explore the abounding pearls of nature strewn everywhere. Make a leisurely visit to the nearby mountain villages, where life flows at a different pace. A walk down to the river Mandakini will make you croon and sing. Or you can just sit back and watch the rushing clouds to put you in a meditative trance. Our warm hospitality will supplement the richness of your stay.

### ACTIVITIES

We organize and facilitate day excursions to the nearby places of Tungnath,Kedarnath, Chopta, Deoria Taal, Okhimath, Guptkashi, Kalimath, Kotma, Ruchh Mahadev, etc. Entire area, called “Kedar Khand” in Skand Purana, is deeply steeped in spiritual flavor and fervor. Join the Yoga sessions. Try your hand in cooking local Garhwali food.

## INTIMACY OF HOMESTAY EXPERIENCE
We try to make your stay simple and uncluttered but soulful and enriching. Nostalgia of the days spent at Trance Himalaya, away from the bustle and noise of urban life, will never leave the warmth of your memories.

### PARTAKE A STEP ON THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED

Trance Himalaya shares a deep bond with SNC, an alternative learning center initiative with emphasis on holistic education. SNC, Space for Nurturing Creativity, is situated 1 km down the slopes from Trance Himalaya. A day trip to the center is a must-do force multiplier to enhance your stay experience. SNC is spread over 20 bighas of land orchard, where the SNC inmates also till, cultivate, and grow local fruits and organic vegetables. A mountain rivulet cascades nearby with a rippling music to make it picture perfect. Together, we can also take a trek down to the river Mandakini to sign off the days’ sojourn.
